# Neovim Setup for Writing

- [Main source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLpGahrsSGQ)

Writing any articles or notes in long form in Neovim is such a rewarding
endeavor if you have the right set up. There are three main objectives to
make it the ultimate writing experience.

- Zen Mode (Make the writing environment less distracting and uncluttered)
  - Twilight (Focus on the paragraph being written)
- Pencil (make the format of the notes or drafts being written legible
  with text wraps, spell checks)
- Markdown Preview (Taking a look at your layout on the web browser)
- Grammar and Spell Checks
- AI (Integrate AI to the workflow for writing... This is discussed in the
  later part (7:22) video.)
